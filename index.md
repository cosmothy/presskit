### Immersive ambient experiences

In Seasons, you'll feel the gentle sound of drizzling rain hitting the water surface as if you're in the midst of rain. Or the roaring of a storm that seems to want to lift the roof, letting you experience the howling of the fierce wind. There are even moments of heavy snowfall, making you shiver as you feel the cold of the ice and snow. With Seasons, you can immerse yourself in listening to different weather sounds and experience the real presence of weather.
